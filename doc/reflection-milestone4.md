# Reflection

## Part One: Accomplishments

Based on the feedback from peer reviews and TA's response, we further improve our shinyapp and make our powerful dashboard easier to use. So far in our shiny app, we successfully adjusted our slider scales to avoid clustered texts and numbers and modified the html code to horizontally align three movies for consistent visuals. We also changed out plot size to include the legends for better interpretations and incorporated the TA's feedback to properly show the axis labels and index for the all the plots. With the downloaded data and reports button, the user now can easily access and save the results of his selections for other uses. 

## Part Two: Limitiations and Future Improvements/Additions

However, our app has a few limitations, and our biggest limitation is that we currently have a limited dataset with only 1000 movies in total and we plan to include larger data with millions of movies in the future. Additionally, our recommendation feature only displays the top 3 movies based on the highest ratings and doesn't account for other features like popularity or demography. The user's history or previous choices is not maintained by the app which could hinder the user experience and there is no way to restart from where they left off. To improve our app, we plan to incorporate these features in the future, providing users with more personalized and diverse recommendations.
