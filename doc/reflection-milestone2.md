## Part One: Accomplishments

So far in our shiny app, we successfully implement most of our proposal and provide the top 3 most recommended movies for our users. Based on users' selection of genres, actors, movie min revenues, the movie release year and runtime ranges, we choose the top 3 movies with the highest rating. The great thing about our dashboard app is that we link multiple user interface choices (drop-down bars and sliders) to each of our plot and by grouping different genres together, we then plot movie counts, rating distribution and runtime distribution interactively for the users' selected choices. Please feel free to use our app and enjoy your movie time!
