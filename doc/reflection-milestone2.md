# Reflection

## Part One: Accomplishments

So far in our shiny app, we successfully implemented most of our proposal goals. Based on the user preferences, we provide our users with the top 3 most recommended movies. Based on users' selection of genres, actors, movie min revenues, the movie release year, and runtime ranges, we choose the top 3 movies with the highest rating. The great thing about our dashboard app is that we link multiple user interface choices (drop-down bars and sliders) to each of our plots. Additionally, by grouping different genres, we then plot movie counts, rating distribution, and runtime distribution interactively for the users' selected choices. Please feel free to use our app and enjoy your movie time!

## Part Two: Limitiations and Future Improvements/Additions

Our dashboard app has successfully implemented a recommendation feature that provides users with the top three recommended movies based on their preferences. The app also provides interactive visualizations such as movie counts, rating distribution, and runtime distribution by grouping different genres. However, our app has a few limitations, and our biggest limitation is that we currently have a limited dataset. Additionally, our recommendation feature only displays the top 3 movies based on the highest ratings and doesn't account for popularity or demography. The user's history or previous choices is not maintained by the app which could hinder the user experience and there is no way to restart from where they left off. Another limitation is there we currently we not offer our users a provision to export their results. To improve our app, we plan to incorporate these features in the future, providing users with more personalized and diverse recommendations.
